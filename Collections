Scala has support for collections. Collections are containers of things. The number of elements could be either 
0 or 1 or more. 
Collections could be either strict or lazy. Lazy means elements donot consume memory until they are accessed.
Scala favors immutable collections although mutable versions are provided.  

If we want to modify a collection and operations on it are all within a single thread, choose mutable collection.
If collection needs to be used across threads or actors, immutables are better.

Another categorization of collections is ether they are mutable or immutable.

Example to define collections:

// Define List of integers.
val x = List(1,2,3,4)

// Define a set.
var x = Set(1,3,5,7)

// Define a map.
val x = Map("one" -> 1, "two" -> 2, "three" -> 3)

// Create a tuple of two elements.
val x = (10, "Scala")

// Define an option
val x:Option[Int] = Some(5)
