Scala has support for collections. Collections are containers of things. The number of elements could be either 
0 or 1 or more. 
Collections could be either strict or lazy. Lazy means elements donot consume memory until they are accessed.
Scala favors immutable collections although mutable versions are provided.  

If we want to modify a collection and operations on it are all within a single thread, choose mutable collection.
If collection needs to be used across threads or actors, immutables are better.

Another categorization of collections is ether they are mutable or immutable.

Example to define collections:
===============================

// Define List of integers.
val x = List(1,2,3,4)

// Define a set.
var x = Set(1,3,5,7)

// Define a map.
val x = Map("one" -> 1, "two" -> 2, "three" -> 3)

// Create a tuple of two elements.
val x = (10, "Scala")

// Define an option
val x:Option[Int] = Some(5)

Scala Lists:
================
Lists are similar to arrays but the key differnece lies in-
  List elements are immutable where as array elements are mutable.
  List represents a linked list whereas arrays are flat.
  
Defining a list:
// List of Strings
val fruit: List[String] = List("apples", "oranges", "pears")

// List of Integers
val nums: List[Int] = List(10, 20, 30, 40)

// Empty List.
val empty: List[Nothing] = List()

// Two dimensional list
val dim: List[List[Int]] =
   List(
      List(1, 0, 0),
      List(0, 1, 0),
      List(0, 0, 1)
      
      
Lists can also be defined using two fundamental blocks- Nil and ::
// List of Strings
val fruit = "apples" :: ("oranges" :: ("pears" :: Nil))

// List of Integers
val nums = 1 :: (2 :: (3 :: (4 :: Nil)))

// Empty List.
val empty = Nil

// Two dimensional list
val dim = (1 :: (0 :: (0 :: Nil))) ::
          (0 :: (1 :: (0 :: Nil))) ::
          (0 :: (0 :: (1 :: Nil))) :: Nil
          
Basic Operations on List:
 val fruit = "apples" :: ("oranges" :: ("pears" :: Nil))
      val nums = Nil

      println( "Head of fruit : " + fruit.head )
      println( "Tail of fruit : " + fruit.tail )
      println( "Check if fruit is empty : " + fruit.isEmpty )
      println( "Check if nums is empty : " + nums.isEmpty )
      
Result:
Head of fruit : apples
Tail of fruit : List(oranges, pears)
Check if fruit is empty : false
Check if nums is empty : true

head -> this method returns first element of the list.
tail -> this method returns a list containing all elements except first.
isEmpty -> this method returns true if the list is empty and otherwise false.

Concatenating Lists:
======================
Use either ::: or List.::: or List.concat() to concatenate two or more lists.
Example:
val fruit1 = "apples" :: ("oranges" :: ("pears" :: Nil))
val fruit2 = "mangoes" :: ("banana" :: Nil)

//concatenating lists
var fruit = fruit1 ::: fruit2
fruit = fruit1.:::(fruit2)
fruit = List.concat(fruit1, fruit2)

Creating Uniform Lists:
