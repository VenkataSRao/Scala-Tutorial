Scala Has below operators

- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Assignment Operators

Arithmetic Operators

+ 	Adds two operands
-	 Subtracts second operand from the first
*	Multiplies both operands	
/	Divides numerator by de-numerator	
%	Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division

Relational Operators

==	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
!=	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
>	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	
<	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
>=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	
<=	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.


Logical Operators

&&	Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non zero then condition becomes true.	
||	Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non zero then condition becomes true.	
! Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.


Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit by bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ are as follows:

p	q	  p & q	  p | q	  p ^ q
0	0	  0	        0	      0
0	1	  0	        1	      1
1	1	  1	        1	      0
1	0	  0	        1	      1
