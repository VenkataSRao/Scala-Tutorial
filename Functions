Function is a group of statements that performs a task. We can divide the code into separate functions ... so each function performs a specific task.
There is minor difference between scala methods and functions.

Method:
========
A method is the one which is part of a class and has name and signature where as scala function is an object that
could be assigned to a variable.


Scala also has support for nested functions.

Syntax of scala Function definition:
===============
def functionName ([list of parameters]) : [return type] = {
   function body
   return [expr]
}

Here return type could be any valid scala data type. list of parameters would be list of variables separated by comma.
return type and list of parameters are optional.
